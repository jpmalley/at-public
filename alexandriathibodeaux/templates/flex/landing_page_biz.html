She helped me navigate through the murky waters of my emotions to a clear decision that brought peace to my soul. Her ability to read between the lines, connect with her surroundings, and attentively listen and pay attention to detail gives her an upper hand to add much needed perspective to a number of scenarios: personal, relational, or professional. I recommend her as a coach to help you align with your inner voice of reason. She is a true delight to converse with and receive amazing feedback!</p>

I have watched you grow and build your business, but aside from the admiration I hold for you as an ever-pursuant businesswoman, I want to focus my gratitude on the services that you provide. After our conversation, Transformation Session, I felt the need to pursue the journey that is Self-Reverence and Love for myself. You are well read and knowledgeable on the ability our minds hold to remold and re-authenticate ourselves, even after enduring trauma! I was a skeptic, I will not lie, as culturally I was taught the good ol, "Toughen up buttercup" mentality. Nevertheless, I went in with a somewhat closed mindedness and you derailed my questionability in just 30 minutes. I am amazed at the revelations that came about and you gave me a safe space to be able to reveal some great and not so great parts of myself. I think when one thinks of a coach, they assume the coach will just tell them what to do. You guide and mold our thoughts in a way that makes us stay true to ourselves and our current abilities. As a scientist I firmly believe, " Success is a science; if you have the conditions, you get the result." A quote from Oscar Wilde. I resolutely affirm that what you are providing are the conditions for our overall self- success. Thank you!</p>
