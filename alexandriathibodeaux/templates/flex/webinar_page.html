                                don't ask for what we want, we'll perpetually be unfulfilled and won't create the life we truly want for ourselves. I'll teach you how to no longer ignore what you want out of your one, precious life!</p>

                                            <p class="m-0">Hey everyone you came at a perfect time in my life. My common-law partner of 5 years broke up with me 2 weeks ago, without any warning or communication before hand. We were still planning our lives together.
                                                We still have to share a bathroom in HIS parents house. He was my support so I have no income, no bank account, no car, no place to live, no friends to rely on or stay with, no family here, and we share
                                                most of our friends. Which have recently shown I can’t trust them with this, and they’ve taken to supporting him instead. Another layer is he has blamed me for his own unhappiness and choices during the
                                                last 2 years of Covid. He’s begun to speak negatively about the details of our separation to our friends which further isolates me from community. On top of that he’s been catching feelings for someone in
                                                another city who he refers to as his “bestie” leading up to the break up and even texted each other the day we broke up and made plans to hook up when he went on vacation this week. It’s been 2 weeks. He’s
                                                portraying that I’m exhausting him, and expects me to be mutual or over it within the first 3 days. All while telling me cares but not helping me through this at all. It’s been a lot of hurt to process so
                                                suddenly. This was my best friend. He’s acting like a teenager now. Not taking any accountability or care. I have to talk to him again, to get him to at least stop talking about me in a negative light, but
                                                i’m not sure how to get him to feel or listen at this point. It’s a small community and it’s very isolating. X</p>

                                            <p>I’m so sorry this is your current experience — I am holding space for you. ❤️</p>
                                            <p>Here’s how I would approach and navigate the conversation with your ex:</p>
                                            <div class="block-quote">
                                                <p>“Hey, John. I know that you are feeling liberated from our relationship and you are allowed to feel that way. With that said, the actions you have taken to suddenly & abruptly end our five year relationship
                                                    have truly devastated me. This process of grieving our relationship is and will continue to be much harder on me than it is on you. And I ask that while you continue to create this new life for yourself,
                                                    that you please don’t say disparaging things about me to our mutual friends. When you do this, it hurts me even more and makes the process of grieving the loss of our shared life unnecessarily cruel
                                                    because it isolates me from community during this intensely difficult time to me. I need to heal and I ask that you please allow me to do that by seeking support from friends. My intention is not to
                                                    disparage you to our friends, but to simply have a community with which to support my grieving of our ended partnership.”</p>

                                            <p>In regards to wanting connection with the these friends: you do not want those people as your friends — they are not aligned with you.</p>
                                            <p>The company you keep are a reflection of your values, beliefs, priorities, and love of self — nurture that aligned community intentionally. Our community also significantly affects our well being & quality of
                                                life.

                                            <p>Of these people have already pledged allegiance to someone who has caused you tremendous hurt and likely trauma, they are not your people.</p>
                                            <p class="m-0">You are worthy of a community who will hear you, see you, support you, and champion you.</p>

                                                <p>And I want to understand your perspective on this too. And before we get there I want to say that if showing me love in my love language doesn’t serve you, if it strains you or bothers you in any way, if
                                                    you feel like you’re compromising parts of yourself to love me in these ways, I want you to please let me know because this relationship is a two-way street and we need to understand each other and understand
                                                    each other‘s experiences to continue nurturing our relationship.</p>
                                                <p>Because the truth is: love is not compromise, love is alignment. And I want us to be in alignment with each other. And I want to make sure that we share that same value.”</p>

                                            <p>Here’s the story:</p>
                                            <p>Me, friend A, friend B were friends. B cut us off for a while because they were going through some things and needed space. (We didn’t know that at the time)</p>
                                            <p>B apologized to me, but not A. With reason though, A was never THAT great of a friend to either of us. I honestly shouldn’t be friends with A, but I can’t let go. A and B got in a huge fight before the friendship
                                                breakup- A said terrible things about B after so B didn’t want to contact them.</p>
                                            <p>I’m friends with B again, and it’s absolutely the right decision. They have grown into an absolutely amazing person, while A seems to be getting more selfish.</p>
                                            <p>A said “if B apologized to anyone, it should’ve been me.” Which really made me mad how selfish and narcissistic</p>
                                            <p>A is also friend with someone my ex cheated on me with, might I add. I don’t even really care cause that was so long ago but it’s the same thing. So in their brain, it’s okay to be friends with someone that
                                                hurt me but me being friends with B isn’t. If I’m hurt it’s fine but not A. Hypocrite. A was mad I wanted to be friends with B again and continues to crap talk B.</p>
                                            <p class="m-0">What do I do if I want both of them to be bridesmaids at my wedding? Any advice in general would be great. This is so childish, I can be friends with whoever I want. It has NO effect on A. B is an absolute angel
                                                and I will continue to be friends with them.</p>

                                            <p>Tell them each individually that because you deeply value them and cherish your friendship, you would be honored to have them as a bridesmaid at your wedding. Then tell them that for those same reasons, it would
                                                be meaningful for you to also have [friend A or B, respectively] as a bridesmaid. Also, tell each friend that you only want them to agree to this if their choice to do so feels aligned for them, honors their
                                                integrity, and protects their peace. Assure each friend that you will understand and respect their decision to politely decline if agreeing to be a bridesmaid would negatively impact their well-being (dishonoring
                                                their integrity and hindering their peace). Assure each friend that because their inner-peace is most important to you, your friendship and value of them as your friend will not suffer if they choose to
                                                politely decline.</p>
