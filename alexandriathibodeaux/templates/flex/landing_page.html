                    <h2>There are copywriters for sales/business articulation. Why&nbsp;aren’t there copywriters for hard conversations?</h2>
                    <p class="pt-3">There are! I made it a thing! <strong>I’m your interpersonal communication copywriter!</strong> I write personalized & tailored scripts for navigating hard conversations.</p>
                    <h4>Need to:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>set a boundry?</li>
                        <li>make a declaration (asserting your thoughts, feelings, and experience)?</li>
                        <li>make a request (ask for what you want and need)?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>I’ll write the script for you!</h4>
                    <p>I articulate the script in a way that preserves your integrity and allows you to assert yourself with clarity, poise, & inner-security.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h2>Benefits to client:</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>This is a</strong> tangible solution.</li>
                        <li><strong>It's a 1-day </strong> solution.</li>
                        <li><strong>It's a booster </strong>; a VIP Day gets you where you need to go quickly.</li>
                        <li><strong>You save time:</strong> you will spend more time working 1-1 with a therapist or with another coach over the course of several weeks, as apposed to working 1-1 with me during a VIP Day, an entire day dedicated to deeply understanding the reality of your unique situation & needs and receiving an aligned & custom resolution to your predicament.</li>
                        <li><strong>No more avoiding.</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>You now have clarity</strong> instead of questions.</li>
                        <li><strong>You use your voice</strong> to speak with clarity & confidence because you now have aligned words to articulate & assert your thoughts & feelings.</li>
                        <li><strong>You honor & preserve</strong> your integrity; this script is not generic or standard -- it will be tailored to your unique, personal reality and challenge.</li>
                        <li><strong>You learn effecitve</strong>, unique, & highly valuable interpersonal communication skills and a strategy for using those skills during future, hard conversations. </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>An information session</strong> &mdash; we will speak on google meet for 2 hours to discuss
                            your needs: the topic, or the task, of communication you need a written script for (a boundary, a declaration, or request), take that information and honor how
                            you want to be represented in this confrontation, and write a uniquely tailored script to
                            guide you through this confrontation with poise, integrity, and inner-security.</li>
                        <li><strong>A completed script</strong> emailed to you by end of day.</li>
                        <li><strong>A coaching session</strong> for us to review and practice the script at the end of the day.</li>

                                            <p class="m-0">Hey everyone you came at a perfect time in my life. My common-law partner of 5 years broke up with me 2 weeks ago, without any warning or communication before hand. We were still planning our lives together. We still have to share a bathroom in HIS parents house. He was my support so I have no income, no bank account, no car, no place to live, no friends to rely on or stay with, no family here, and we share most of our friends. Which have recently shown I can’t trust them with this, and they’ve taken to supporting him instead. Another layer is he has blamed me for his own unhappiness and choices during the last 2 years of Covid. He’s begun to speak negatively about the details of our separation to our friends which further isolates me from community. On top of that he’s been catching feelings for someone in another city who he refers to as his “bestie” leading up to the break up and even texted each other the day we broke up and made plans to hook up when he went on vacation this week. It’s been 2 weeks. He’s portraying that I’m exhausting him, and expects me to be mutual or over it within the first 3 days. All while telling me cares but not helping me through this at all. It’s been a lot of hurt to process so suddenly. This was my best friend. He’s acting like a teenager now. Not taking any accountability or care. I have to talk to him again, to get him to at least stop talking about me in a negative light, but i’m not sure how to get him to feel or listen at this point. It’s a small community and it’s very isolating. X</p>

                                            <p>Here’s how I would approach and navigate the conversation with your ex:</p>

                                                <p>“Hey, John. I know that you are feeling liberated from our relationship and you are allowed to feel that way. With that said, the actions you have taken to suddenly & abruptly end our five year relationship have truly devastated me. This process of grieving our relationship is and will continue to be much harder on me than it is on you. And I ask that while you continue to create this new life for yourself, that you please don’t say disparaging things about me to our mutual friends. When you do this, it hurts me even more and makes the process of grieving the loss of our shared life unnecessarily cruel because it isolates me from community during this intensely difficult time to me. I need to heal and I ask that you please allow me to do that by seeking support from friends. My intention is not to disparage you to our friends, but to simply have a community with which to support my grieving of our ended partnership.”</p>

                                            <p>In regards to wanting connection with the these friends: you do not want those people as your friends — they are not aligned with you.</p>
                                            <p>The company you keep are a reflection of your values, beliefs, priorities, and love of self — nurture that aligned community intentionally. Our community also significantly affects our well being & quality of life.</p>
                                            <p>Of these people have already pledged allegiance to someone who has caused you tremendous hurt and likely trauma, they are not your people.</p>
                                            <p class="m-0">You are worthy of a community who will hear you, see you, support you, and champion you.</p>

                                                <p>And in this loving relationship, I want to ensure that we are loving each other in ways that serve both ourselves and the other person.</p>

                                                <p>And I bring this up because in my experience, when I share with you my love language, so the ways I want and need to be loved, the ways that align with me, I feel as though you aren’t internalizing my words and making efforts to take action in loving me in the ways I’ve expressed to you I want to be loved.</p>
                                                <p>And I want to understand your perspective on this too. And before we get there I want to say that if showing me love in my love language doesn’t serve you, if it strains you or bothers you in any way, if you feel like you’re compromising parts of yourself to love me in these ways, I want you to please let me know because this relationship is a two-way street and we need to understand each other and understand each other‘s experiences to continue nurturing our relationship.</p>
                                                <p>Because the truth is: love is not compromise, love is alignment. And I want us to be in alignment with each other. And I want to make sure that we share that same value.”</p>

                                            <p><strong>How do I set boundaries?</strong></p>
                                            <p>Here’s the story:</p>
                                            <p>Me, friend A, friend B were friends. B cut us off for a while because they were going through some things and needed space. (We didn’t know that at the time)</p>
                                            <p>B apologized to me, but not A. With reason though, A was never THAT great of a friend to either of us. I honestly shouldn’t be friends with A, but I can’t let go. A and B got in a huge fight before the friendship breakup- A said terrible things about B after so B didn’t want to contact them.</p>
                                            <p>I’m friends with B again, and it’s absolutely the right decision. They have grown into an absolutely amazing person, while A seems to be getting more selfish.</p>
                                            <p>A said “if B apologized to anyone, it should’ve been me.” Which really made me mad how selfish and narcissistic</p>
                                            <p>A is also friend with someone my ex cheated on me with, might I add. I don’t even really care cause that was so long ago but it’s the same thing. So in their brain, it’s okay to be friends with someone that hurt me but me being friends with B isn’t. If I’m hurt it’s fine but not A. Hypocrite. A was mad I wanted to be friends with B again and continues to crap talk B.</p>
                                            <p class="m-0">What do I do if I want both of them to be bridesmaids at my wedding?  Any advice in general would be great. This is so childish, I can be friends with whoever I want. It has NO effect on A. B is an absolute angel and I will continue to be friends with them.</p>

                                            <p>Tell them each individually that because you deeply value them and cherish your friendship, you would be honored to have them as a bridesmaid at your wedding. Then tell them that for those same reasons, it would be meaningful for you to also have [friend A or B, respectively] as a bridesmaid. Also, tell each friend that you only want them to agree to this if their choice to do so feels aligned for them, honors their integrity, and protects their peace. Assure each friend that you will understand and respect their decision to politely decline if agreeing to be a bridesmaid would negatively impact their well-being (dishonoring their integrity and hindering their peace). Assure each friend that because their inner-peace is most important to you, your friendship and value of them as your friend will not suffer if they choose to politely decline.</p>

                                    Working with Alexandria has helped me to move out of place of judgement of myself and get in touch with the parts of myself that need healing. She has helped me navigate where I need to work in a way that is very straight forward and catered to my specific situation. She is amazing and tapping into exactly what I need to focus on with clear instructions and is careful that it is something that feels safe for me. I love working with her, it has changed my&nbsp;life.

                                    Alexandria provided me with clear and concise questions to ask myself during a time period in my life where the decision I was faced with was in a total gray area. She helped me navigate through the murky waters of my emotions to a clear decision that brought peace to my soul. Her ability to read between the lines, connect with her surroundings, and attentively listen and pay attention to detail gives her an upper hand to add much needed perspective to a number of scenarios: personal, relational, or professional. I recommend her as a coach to help you align with your inner voice of reason. She is a true delight to converse with and receive amazing feedback!

                                    As an HSP, it can be challenging and overwhelming to navigate this insensitive world; my transformation session with Alexandria was what my soul needed. I felt so seen, validated, celebrated, and empowered! I learned, healed, and feel cleared of any self-doubts I was experiencing. Thank you Alexandria for this empowering and healing session!

                                    I had a brief coaching session with Alexandria to help clarify a decision I am making. She was quickly able to help me see the situation more clearly and gave me effective tools to help evaluate my decision. She is very kind, warm and understanding. Alexandria is a wonderful speaker and a wise and helpful guide. I’m grateful for her clarity and support.
